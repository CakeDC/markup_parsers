# Markup Parsers Plugin for CakePHP #

for cake 2.x

This plugin offers a solution for working with different type of markup for you application. It offers both some markup parser implementations and a parser factory responsible for registering available parser classes and returning instances of them.

It provides three different markup implementations:

## BBcode Parser ##

Supports the [b], [p], [u], [s], [sub], [sup]. [indent], [img], [color], [code], [color], [size], [font]. [align], [quote], [h1] ... [h6], [table] and it's associated [tr], [th] and [td], [list], [ulist] and [li]. It can also link emails and urls using the [url] tag

This parser will also split the passed string in pages, using the [Page separator] marker as separator.

## Markdown Parser ##

Supports regular markdown syntax with a few exceptions and additions:

    * reference style links are not supported, only inline links work.
    * Setext style headers are not supported, only ATX style headers work.
    * Block quotes are not implemented at this time.

As this class was original intended to parse functions doc blocks, it has some additional syntax items:

    * Class::method() links. These are links to other class + methods in your code base.
    * Class::$property links. These are links to other class properties in your code base.
    * Code blocks - Code blocks can be indicated with either {{{ code }}} or @@@ code @@@ or indented.

## Html ##

The simplest of all parsers, it just adds some sugar to split a HTML string into multiple pages, and strip some dangerous content.

This parser splits the input string in multiple pages using the `<!--Page Separator-->` marker as separator

## The ParserRegistry Class##

Every parser needs to be configured so they can be instantiated by the helper using the ParserRegistry class. To configure the parsers you are going to use in your app use the Configure class to list them.

        Configure::write('Parsers.markdown' => array(
			'name' => 'Markdown',
			'class' => array('MarkdownParser', 'MarkupParsers.Parser'), 
		));

If you have your own parser implementation you can list it to into the array this way:

        Configure::write('Parsers.my_parser' => array(
		    'name' => 'MyParser',
		    'class' => array('MyParser', 'MyPlugin.Parser'),
	    ));

## Writing a parser ##

You can develop your own parser or extend the shipped ones for your specific needs.
A Parser class must be a Library implementing the `ParserInterface` shipped as a plugin lib.

Here is a simple Parser example:

	App::uses('ParserInterface', 'MarkupParsers.Lib');
	class FoobarParser implements ParserInterface {
		public function parse($string, $options = array()) {
			return str_replace('foo', 'bar', $string);
		}
	}

Then you can access it from the ParserRegistry after configuring it as detailed previously.

## Using the helper ##

To use any parser in your views just include the Parser helper into the $helpers array in your controller:

        public $helpers = array('MarkupParsers.Parser');

And in your views

        echo $this->Parser->parse($string, 'my_parser'); // the second parameter can be left blank ad will use 'markdown' as default


## Requirements ##

* PHP version: PHP 5.2+
* CakePHP version: Cakephp 2.x Stable

## Support ##

## Branch strategy ##

The master branch holds the STABLE latest version of the plugin. 
Develop branch is UNSTABLE and used to test new features before releasing them. 

Previous maintenance versions are named after the CakePHP compatible version, for example, branch 1.3 is the maintenance version compatible with CakePHP 1.3.
All versions are updated with security patches.

## Contributing to this Plugin ##

Please feel free to contribute to the plugin with new issues, requests, unit tests and code fixes or new features. If you want to contribute some code, create a feature branch from develop, and send us your pull request. Unit tests for new features and issues detected are mandatory to keep quality high.
